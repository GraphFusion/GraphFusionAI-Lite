Implementation Considerations
Technical Decisions

 Choose communication patterns (pub/sub, request/response, event-driven)
 Select consistency models (eventual, strong, causal)
 Decide on serialization formats (JSON, Protocol Buffers, MessagePack)
 Pick distributed coordination tools (etcd, Consul, Zookeeper)
 Choose message brokers (RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Redis)

Testing Strategy

 Unit tests for individual agents
 Integration tests for agent interactions
 Load testing for scalability
 Chaos engineering for resilience
 End-to-end workflow testing

Documentation and Maintenance

 Architecture documentation
 API documentation
 Deployment guides
 Troubleshooting runbooks
 Performance tuning guides

This checklist covers the essential components needed for a robust multi-agent system framework. Prioritize the core architecture components first, then build out the management, monitoring, and advanced features based on your specific use case requirements.

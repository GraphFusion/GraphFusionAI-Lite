### **How Developers Will Build Agents**
Developers will follow a simple workflow:  
1. **Define an Agent**: Create a custom agent by extending a base class or using a factory function.  
2. **Assign Roles & Capabilities**: Specify what the agent does, including tasks, memory use, and collaboration style.  
3. **Register the Agent**: Add it to the shared graph so it can interact with others.  
4. **Execute Tasks**: Use the execution engine to run tasks, delegate, or collaborate.

### **Proposed API for Developers**
Developers should be able to define and use agents **in just a few lines of code**:

```python
from graphfusionai import Agent, TaskExecutor, SharedKnowledgeGraph

# Step 1: Create a Shared Graph
graph = SharedKnowledgeGraph()

# Step 2: Define Custom Agents
class DataAgent(Agent):
    def run(self):
        self.log("Processing data...")
        self.memory.store("processed_data", "Sample result")

class MLAgent(Agent):
    def run(self):
        data = self.memory.retrieve("processed_data")
        self.log(f"Training model on {data}...")

# Step 3: Register Agents
data_agent = DataAgent("DataProcessor", graph)
ml_agent = MLAgent("ModelTrainer", graph)

# Step 4: Execute Tasks
executor = TaskExecutor()
executor.run(data_agent)
executor.run(ml_agent)
```

### **Next Steps to Improve Developer Experience**
- **Provide Prebuilt Agent Templates**: Developers can extend pre-existing agent roles (e.g., "DataProcessor", "Planner", "Evaluator").  
- **Agent Factory**: Allow dynamic creation of agents without subclassing.  
- **Declarative Agent Setup**: YAML/JSON configs for defining agent behaviors without coding.  
- **Interactive CLI**: Let users spawn, manage, and debug agents via a command-line tool.  

Would you like to move forward with this **agent development API** or tweak the design? ðŸš€

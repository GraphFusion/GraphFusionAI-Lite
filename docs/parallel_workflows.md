# Parallel and Conditional Workflows

## Team Initialization
```python
# Proper team initialization pattern
project_team = Team(
    team_id="project_alpha",
    graph_manager=graph_manager,
    state_db=None,
    auto_save_interval=60
)
project_team.agents = {
    "analyst1": data_analyst,
    "researcher1": research_specialist
}
```

## Timeout Configuration
- Global workflow timeout (default: 300s)
- Per-task timeouts (recommended: 30-60s)
- Timeout error handling

## Best Practices
1. Always initialize GraphManager first
2. Set reasonable timeouts for each task
3. Use debug logging during development
4. Handle workflow cancellation gracefully
